# gtk-test
Gtk Swift test application

You need to [download and install](https://swift.org/download/) a Swift 3.0 toolchain by yourself.

Dependencies:

### OS X

Make sure $(which swift) points to a Swift 3.0 toolchain! The default Xcode toolchain does NOT support the Swift Package Manager.

Install Gtk+ and CMake via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install gtk+3 cmake
```

### Linux

Make sure the Swift toolchain is in your $PATH.

Install Gtk+ and CMake from the repositories. Ubuntu example:

```bash
sudo apt-get libgtk-3-dev cmake
```

### Windows

No.
